// Let n be the number of base objects that are being clustered (leaves of the
// dendrogram). Consider a representation of a dendrogram for a similarity graph
// in the parent array format, i.e., a vector or sequence of length <= 2*n-1
// containing, for each vertex, the id of its parent cluster and a floating
// point value indicating the similarity of this merge (the merge-similarity).
// Let m(u) be the *reported* merge-similarity of the merge creating a cluster
// u. For leaves (clusters of size 1), m(u) = \infty.
//
// Please note that the similarity stored in the dendrogram (the reported
// similarity) may be a multiplicative factor off from the true similarity of
// the underlying merge. For example, for the ParHac code, the true similarity
// of this merge may be a (1+epsilon) factor smaller than the stored similarity.
// In what follows, m(u) refers to the reported similarity.
//
// Note that for a dendrogram obtained by running the exact HAC algorithm using
// any reducible linkage function, e.g., unweighted average-linkage, the HAC
// algorithm ensures that the leaf-to-root paths are monotonically decreasing.
// However, if the HAC algorithm is approximate, the dendrogram may be
// non-monotone, i.e., we could have a leaf-to-root path where merge
// similarities *increase* along a leaf-to-root path. This piece of code
// computes three types of approximation factors for a dendrogram. Given a node
// u, let p(u) be the parent of u and let A(u) be the set of ancestors of u,
// including u. Let C be the set of all clusters in the graph.
//
// The utilities in this file help compute four kinds of approximation factors
// for a dendrogram:
// (1) max global approximation factor, i.e.,
//     max_{u in C} [max_{a in A(u)} m(a)] / m(u)
// (2) max local approximation factor, i.e.,
//     max_{u in C} m(p(u)) / m(u)
// (3) the maximum approximation for a merge, i.e.,
//     max_{u in C} MaxSim(u) / m(u)
//     where MaxSim(u) is the highest similarity edge at the time u is merged.
// (4) the goodness of the dendrogram, as defined in go/terahac-paper. For
//     complete dendrograms, this is equal to (3), but the two may diverge if
//     we only look at a subset of dendrogram merges.
//
// For exact algorithms, (1) = 1 and (2) <= 1.
// If (3) is equal to 1, then the dendrogram is exact (up to ties).
//
// These approximation factors can be used, for example, to check that an
// approximate HAC algorithm is working correctly, or to empirically bound the
// error from a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
