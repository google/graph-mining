// Config for CoconductanceClusterer, which optimizes for co-conductance, which
// is a clustering quality measure defined as follows.
// Given an undirected graph with weighted edges, for a cluster C define:
//  * vol(C) = total weighted degree of nodes within C
//  * E(C) = total weight of all undirected edges with both endpoints in C
//  * ccond(C) = 2E(C) / vol(C)
// Then, given an exponent p > 0, we define the coconductance of the clustering
// C_1, ..., C_k to be sum ccond(C_i)^p for i = i, ..., k
// This seems to be a reasonable method for finding dense clusters, even in the
// absence of weights. See go/coconductance-paper for details.
// The algorithm optimizes co-conductance using Louvain algorithm.
