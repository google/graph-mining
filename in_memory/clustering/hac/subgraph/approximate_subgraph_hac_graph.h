namespace graph_mining::in_memory {

// This class maintains a graph data structure that maintains an edge weighted
// subgraph of a graph under merges using the average-linkage formula. Note that
// the graph makes a distinction between active nodes (i.e. nodes "owned" by
// this subgraph and eligible to be merged) and inactive nodes (nodes owned by a
// different subgraph, and thus will never be merged from the perspective of
// this subgraph).
// The structure provides efficient access to the "goodness" of the edges as the
// merges occur.
//
// The goodness of an edge (u,v) is defined as:
//   goodness(u,v) = max(WMax(u), WMax(v)) /
//                   min(M(u), M(v), w(u,v))
// where WMax(u) is the max weight edge incident to u, and M(u) is the min-merge
// value of u, i.e., the minimum merge similarity of any merge that forms the
// cluster u.  If we always perform merges of edges that have goodness(u,v) <=
// 1+epsilon, then we can show that the algorithm is (1+epsilon)-approximate.
//
// This class maintains a dynamic graph data structure that efficiently:
// (1) produces edges with goodness <= 1+epsilon (see below for details)
// (2) merges two clusters u, v into a cluster (u U v).
//
// This is a special case of a more general "GoodnessGraph" data structure that
// can query for edges in any range of goodness values.
//
// The properties above are useful for implementing an efficient SubgraphHAC
// algorithm (i.e., merging all (1+epsilon)-good edges in a subgraph).
//
// Our implementation of GoodnessGraph is itself approximate. In particular, if
// Goodness*(u,v) is the true goodness of (u,v), we maintain an approximate
// value, ApxGoodness(u,v) s.t.:
//   Goodness*(u,v) <= ApxGoodness(u,v) <=  (1+alpha) x Goodness*(u,v).
// so [ApxGoodness(u,v) <= 1+epsilon] also implies [Goodness*(u,v) <= 1+epsilon]
//
// Our implementation will emit all edges with ApxGoodness(u,v) <= 1+epsilon, so
// when the algorithm stops returning edges we know that there are no more edges
// remaining with [Goodness*(u,v) <= (1+epsilon)/(1+\alpha)].
//
// See the Appendix of https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03578 for more details on the
// dynamic graph representation implemented in this file and its guarantees.
//
// Another implementation detail is that weights stored in the graph are
// normalized by the neighbor endpoints cluster size, and implicitly normalized
// by the source's cluster size.
//
// Terminology and Invariants:
// - epsilon: never return an edge with goodness > (1+epsilon).
// - alpha: 0 <= alpha <= epsilon. Controls the frequency with which the
//   algorithm performs "broadcasts", e.g., of goodness reassignment, or
//   broadcasting a node's cluster size to its neighbors.
// - w(u,v): the weight of an edge (u,v). We maintain a (1+alpha) approximation
//   (since cluster sizes are broadcasted only after they grow by a (1+alpha)
//   factor). If w*(u,v) is the true weight, we guarantee that:
//       w*(u,v) <= w(u,v) <= (1+alpha) x w*(u,v)
// - active/inactive node: active nodes are nodes that are *in* this
//   subgraph, and are eligible to be merged. Inactive nodes are not eligible
//   to participate in merges.
// - Best(v): the highest weight incident edge to v (could be either to an
//   active or inactive node). Since we just return the heaviest weight edge we
//   also get a (1+alpha) approximation for Best(v):
//       Best*(v) <= Best(v) <= (1+alpha) x Best*(v)
// - Goodness(u,v): Since the goodness calculation uses one of {Best(u),Best(v)}
//   and (potentially) w(u,v), we also get a (1+alpha) approximation:
//       Goodness*(u,v) <= Goodness(u,v) <=  (1+alpha) x Goodness*(u,v)
//   Note that the goodness being <= (1+epsilon) means that we get a (1+epsilon)
//   approximation.
